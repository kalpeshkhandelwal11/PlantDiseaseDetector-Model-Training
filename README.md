# PlantDiseaseDetector-Model-Training


This is Collab File (ipynp) to train model for detecting plant disease.

Ps: you have to upload a Kaggle.json file which you will get from your kaggle account after activating api . https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-fetch-kaggle-datasets-into-google-colab-ea682569851a Yo can follow this to get the json file. Upload the json file directly to collab .

Treatment might not work because You need to add data manually to firebase.

ping me if you have any issue .
